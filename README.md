# fdf
##  Description of the Project
##### Introduction to basics of graphic programming. The goal of this project is to create a simplified graphic "wireframe" representation of a landscape via various points. The program takes a file as a parameter which contains the coordinates of certain landscape and creates a simple 3D map of the landscape. 

##  What I learned from this Project
##### How to place coordinates in space and how to join them with segments
##### Be able to calculate and project the coordinates from a particular viewpoint. 

##  How to use
##### 1.git clone https://github.com/cookietho/fdf.git
##### 2.cd to fdf directory
##### 3.run make to compile and link the sources
##### 4.make will create an excutable file called fdf
##### 5.execution: ./fdf <FILE.fdf>   Width > 1200	Height > 900
